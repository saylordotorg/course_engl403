**Unit 1: An Introduction to the Gothic** <span id="1"></span> 
*Though originally maligned as a “low” literary form, not worthy of
serious study, the Gothic novel has more recently come into favor among
literary scholars, who see in it a wealth of subversive literary
features.  In this unit you will read a number of scholarly essays
exploring the Gothic in order to engage with the debates surrounding the
genre and to acquaint yourself with critical approaches and reading
methods that you may choose to challenge or adopt for yourself.  The
unit will touch briefly upon the novel versus other forms of the Gothic
and conclude with a review of the genre’s hallmark devices, figures, and
tropes, which, as Professor Eugenia DeLamotte noted, almost became
clichés before they were conventions.*

the decaying presence of the past in the here and now and even in the
future; they are often symbols of the sins of the past that persist into
the present.*

**1.3.6 Gender-Bending and Sexual Deviance** <span id="1.3.6"></span> 
*One of the frequently recurring themes of the Gothic novel concerns
sexual taboos.  Historically in the West, there have been taboos against
homosexuality, sexual drive in women, and incest, among others. 
Discussing – let alone changing – these taboos has often been a source
of terror within the ruling power structure of a given society.*
