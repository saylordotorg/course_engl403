**Unit 4: Gender and Sexuality** <span id="4"></span> 
*The field of Gothic studies is home to a number of feminist and queer
theorists – and for good reason.  The novels that you have already read,
and especially those that you will encounter in this unit, often overtly
present psycho-sexual behavior, lust and seduction, and cross-dressing
and gender confusion as central themes.  In this unit you will take a
look at these issues, teasing them out and examining their relationship
to other Gothic devices and themes.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 32.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 15.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 17 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Discuss terror and horror in Lewis’ *The Monk* in terms of
    contemporary cultural taboos.
-   Identify and discuss the Gothic conditions for the female characters
    in *The Monk*, Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper,” and Brontë’s *Jane
    Eyre*.
-   Identify and explain examples of “queer” or deviant (for the time)
    sexuality in Gothic novels.
-   Compare the representation of Thornfield to that of the Gothic
    castles in earlier Gothic fiction.
-   Discuss the concept of the ideal woman versus the “new woman” in
    Victorian England.
