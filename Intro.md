Course Syllabus for "ENGL403: The Gothic Novel"
-----------------------------------------------

What makes a novel “Gothic”?  Scholars have debated this question for
decades: some consider “the Gothic” a literary time period, spanning
from the 1760s to 1820; others view it as a set of thematic concerns;
still others understand it as a literary mode, in which contemporary
authors like Stephen King continue to write.  In this course, you will
explore these and other definitions as you read a number of novels (and
have the option to screen a film), attempting to define for yourself the
term “Gothic.”  You will supplement your studies with critical
literature on the Gothic novel and literary mode, critiquing and
adapting the approaches and theories as you see fit. You will begin the
course with an overview of approaches to the literary Gothic and an
outline of its stereotypical characteristics and elements.  You will
then progress through the course by examining Gothic novels (and an
optional film) in three thematic categories (which, as you will see,
often overlap): Gothic Spaces, the Monstrous Other, and Gender and
Sexuality. The Gothic novel is at one and the same time a specific
English literary event and a set of literary qualities that persist in
American and European novels and films to the present day.  The Gothic
era of English literature begins with the novelist Horace Walpole
(1717-1797) and the 1765 publication of *The Castle of Otranto: A Gothic
Story*.  Some scholars suggest that the last great novel of the era is
*Melmoth the Wanderer* by Charles Robert Maturin (1782-1824); it was
published in 1820.  The literary Gothic, on the other hand, refers to a
set of themes and conventions, whose roots and sensibilities originate
in the English Gothic novels of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
century.  After 1820, books and later films are described as Gothic
because their creators have adapted and expanded the plots, narrative
devices, and themes of the Gothic era of English literature, bringing
new life to the genre by reflecting on contemporary political, social,
and economic issues.  What all Gothic literature and film have in common
is the exploration of contemporary taboos, creating an atmosphere of
terror.  The taboo subjects change over time, but the fear and trembling
that they invoke do not.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

-   Provide a general description of the Gothic novel as well as the key
    terms associated with it, and cite specific examples of the
    conventions, tropes, and terms from the novels the student has read.
-   Distinguish between “terror” and “horror” in the context of Gothic
    literary studies, and cite examples of each.
-   Explain how the original era of the Gothic novel is consistent with
    but also diverges from the rise of the English novel of the time.
-   Discuss the differences between the English Gothic novel of the
    original era and the English Gothic novel of the Victorian Age from
    the novels the student has read.
-   Explain how the themes of each assigned Gothic novel reflect
    contemporary cultural concerns.
-   Discuss the significance of buildings – such as castles, abbeys, and
    mansions – in Gothic novels, and explain the psychological
    implications of the representation of these spaces.
-   Critically discuss the theme of “otherness” in the Gothic novel,
    with attention both to the historical significance of the “other”
    and to the supernatural representation of the “monster” figure.
-   Identify themes of sexuality, gender, and feminism in Gothic novels
    as part of the novels’ creation of psychological terror.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1 because it lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material in later units. 
You will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Assessment
-   Unit 2 Assessments
-   Unit 3 Assessments
-   Unit 4 Assessments
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
In order to prepare adequately for the exam, however, you will need to
work through the assessments listed above, as well as other readings and
material in each unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** The course should take you a total of
approximately **150.5 hours** to complete.  Units include “time
advisories” that list the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  They should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may
be useful to take a look at the time advisories to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you
approximately 22.75 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1.1 through 1.1.3
(approximately 3.25 hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.1.4 and 1.1.5
(approximately 2.5 hours) on Tuesday night; subunits 1.1.6 and 1.1.7
(approximately 2.25 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.
