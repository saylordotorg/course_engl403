     Instructions: Before you read the full text of *The Mysteries of
    Udolpho*, please read Dr. Melani’s “Ann Radcliffe” essay for an
    introduction to the novelist and her most prominent themes.  Because
    the novel is rather lengthy, you may want to break up the reading as
    follows: read Volume I during subunits 2.2.1 and 2.2.2; read Volume
    II during subunits 2.2.3-2.2.5; read Volume III during subunits
    2.2.6 and 2.2.7; ad read Volume IV during subunits 2.2.8 and
    2.2.9.  
      
     For many readers, *The Mysteries of Udolpho* is the archetypical
    Gothic novel: crumbling castles, a damsel in distress, supernatural
    events, and a brooding villain all feature prominently in the work,
    making it an easy target for parody (which Jane Austen executed
    brilliantly in her *Northanger Abbey*).  Even so, it is a rich find
    for the Gothic enthusiast.  
      
     Reading these resources should take approximately 12 hours.

**2.2.5 The Sublime** <span id="2.2.5"></span> 
*The “sublime” is a philosophical concept as well as a descriptive
term.  Although first discussed by the ancient philosopher Longinus, the
notion of the sublime receives significant critical attention in the
eighteenth century by philosophers such as Edmund Burke and Immanuel
Kant.  Inspired by extreme landscapes and natural phenomena such as the
Alps, these thinkers articulated the concurrent yet seemingly opposite
sensations associated with the sublime: inspiration, awe, and respect
for that which is greater than oneself versus fear, terror, and desire
to be greater than one’s current self.  The sublime, therefore,
encourages man toward artistic and creative heights; at the same time,
it explains how man can distort and pervert the natural world in his
striving to exceed it.*
