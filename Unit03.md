**Unit 3: The Monstrous Other** <span id="3"></span> 
Frankenstein *may be the most famous of the Gothic novels; it has been
adapted and reincarnated innumerable times since its initial publication
in 1818.  Part of the novel’s popularity relates to its figuration of
the monster, an archetype that appears in a number of Gothic novels and
has become something of a cultural icon in its various iterations,
particularly in recent years, with the fantastic commercial success of
vampire-related fiction.  In this unit you will explore the
representation of the monster or the “Other” in the Gothic novel,
relating it to matters of gender, race, the unknown, and more.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 43 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 21.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 21.75 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Identify the origin of and define the term “uncanny” as it relates
    to Gothic fiction.
-   Explain the representation of the monster in Shelley’s
    *Frankenstein* as “other” in terms of historical developments
    contemporaneous to the novel’s publication.
-   Identify and explain the references to the Garden of Eden and the
    Prometheus myth in *Frankenstein*.
-   Outline the origins of the vampire myth in order to determine the
    implications of its recurrence in popular culture and the Gothic
    novel in particular.
-   Discuss the contemporary cultural fears that inform Stoker’s
    *Dracula*.

**3.2 Dracula** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*The Victorian Age refers first to the period of time in which Queen
Victoria ruled the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
(1837-1901) and second to a set of values associated with her reign. 
“Victorian” connotes strict personal morality, particularly in relation
to women’s sexual activity and to heterosexuality; the ethical value of
hard work; an allegiance to the Church of England as superior to the
medieval heritage of the Catholic Church and to the alien and mysterious
customs of Judaism; the strict maintenance of the British class system;
and the perceived superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race and of Great
Britain in particular.  The latter three preceded Victoria’s reign and
have already figured in the themes and motivations at work in the first
wave of English Gothic novels.  *Dracula *represents a late-Victorian
novel; it plays into England’s fear of cultural and political change –
from foreign invasion to the rise of women in the public sphere.*

     Instructions: Please read *Dracula*.  Since the novel is long,
    please feel free to break up the reading as follows: read Chapters

    read Chapters 8-12 during subunit 3.3.3; read Chapters 13-17 during
    subunit 3.3.4; read Chapters 18-22 during subunit 3.3.5; read
    Chapters 22-27 during subunit 3.3.6.  
      
     Though *Dracula* was written well after the period most commonly
    associated with “The Gothic” (1897 versus 1760s-1820), it is
    frequently categorized as such, as it includes elements of the
    unknown, horror-inducing incidents, and the monstrous Other in
    disguise.

    approximately 10 hours.
